execline
________________________________________________________________________________

execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh - but its syntax is
quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb program is meant
to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other commands are essentially
useful inside an execlineb script. execline is as powerful as a shell: it
features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and
more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's
syntax, and has no security issues. [0]
